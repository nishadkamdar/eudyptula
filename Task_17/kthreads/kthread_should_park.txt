/**
 * kthread_should_park - should this kthread park now?

 * When someone calls kthread_park() on your kthread, it will be woken
 * and this will return true.  You should then do the necessary
 * cleanup and call kthread_parkme()
 *
 * Similar to kthread_should_stop(), but this keeps the thread alive
 * and in a park position. kthread_unpark() "restarts" the thread and
 * calls the thread function again.
